Ik zal dus nooit een model kiezen o.b.v. AUC waarden alleen. Op basis van deze getallen vermoed ik dat EBM en Logit qua model erg veel op elkaar lijken (met categorische variabelen ook niet zo vreemd) en kan ik daar op basis van deze gegevens ook niet echt tussen kiezen. Hangt af van hoe de EBM plaatjes eruit zien. Logit is dan de meest vertrouwde en bekende keuze.;"Zie chat ;)
Succes met je onderzoek."

For example. in the medical scorecard example a SLIM model might be more effective in terms of user adoption, whereas in the financial sector a higher complexity might be allowed for to achieve higher accuracy.;

If it is of the utmost importance to have a high accuracy, then the choice must be XGBOOST/SHAP. However, in a regular business setting this loss of performance of a logistic regression would be acceptable in favor of 100% transparancy. ;

Also taking other ML tasks in to account and validate how general a 'explainer' toolbox is, is also a valuable fact.

Adding or removing a beta affects the probability, but difficult to assess. SLIM method is very clear, only unclear part is showing more rows then the rows needed for the descision.;Graphics load very slow.

EBM looks to me to be equivalent here as all the features are categorical. The SLIM model that was shown seems overly simple for most use cases, at the expense of predictive performance. XGBoost is usually a good option if one only cares about predictive performance, but it is hard-to-understand and not transparent, which seems like a problem in this hypothetical scenario. Adding an explainer model that itself is hard-to-understand and not transparent does not necessarily help the case, although it can sometimes be a useful tool for getting stakeholders to trust the model.;If you have a good implementation of SLIM, please share. Good luck with your thesis!
